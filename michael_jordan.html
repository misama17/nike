                <h1>Michael Jordan</h1> 
                <p>When it comes to athletes, few figures loom larger in the collective imagination than NBA legend, <strong>Michael Jordan</strong>. 
                Over the course of his storied career and beyond, Jordan, considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time, 
                has also been hailed as an icon of marketing, thanks to lucrative endorsement dealsâ€”chief among them, his longtime partnership with Nike, 
                whose gargantuan impact in the sports shoe industry is largely attributed to their initial deal with Jordan.
                It also heralded a global revolution in the way sport was marketed and players were rewarded. Michael opened up the door for Black athletes in earning a lot of money off their endorsements.</p>
                <h2>Michael Jordan with Nike</h2>
                <p>On October 26, 1984, Michael Jordan signed a five-year, US$2.5 million deal with Nike, three times more than any other deal in the National Basketball Association (NBA) at the time. 
                Nike released the Air Jordan sneaker line in April 1985 with the goal of making $3 million in the first three years. Sales greatly exceeded expectations, earning $126 million in one year.
                The NBA policy stated that the shoes must be 51% white and in accordance with the shoes that the rest of the team was wearing. 
                Failure to follow this policy resulted in a $5,000 fine per game (equivalent to $14,000 in 2022). 
                Nike designed the Air Jordan I based on the Chicago Bulls' red and black team colors with only 23% white, which violated the NBA's policy. 
                Nike agreed to pay each fine, garnering both controversy and publicity around the shoe. Fines imposed by the NBA on Jordan for wearing the shoes bestowed upon them an iconic brand and was later regarded as groundbreaking in part due to its defiance of NBA regulations. 
                Nike also took advantage of this marketing opportunity with the Air Jordan I "Banned" advertisement, which stated "On September 15th, Nike created a revolutionary new basketball shoe. On October 18th, the NBA threw them out of the game.                     
                Fortunately, the NBA can't keep you from wearing them. Air Jordan. From Nike." The shoe sold out at 50,000 pairs and generated more than $150 million in sales.</p>
                <h2>His accomplishments</h2>
                <p>He's the GOAT, the Greatest of All Time. It's not so much a boast as a consensus. Most observers of the game of basketball, 
                as he liked to say, agree Michael Jeffrey Jordan with his combination of skill, will and accomplishment is the greatest player the game ever has seen.
                Jordan played 13 seasons with the Bulls with a year and a half hiatus to play baseball in the Chicago White Sox minor league system. 
                He finished his playing career with two seasons with the Washington Wizards and went on to become the owner of the Charlotte Hornets.
                Jordan won six championships with the Bulls and was named Finals MVP all six times. He was the NBA Most Valuable Player five times and a 14-time All-Star. 
                He was All-Star game MVP three times and Defensive Player of the Year. He was all-defensive first team nine times and the NBA scoring leader 10 times. He led the league in steals three times and was All-Star slam dunk champion twice.
                He was an NCAA champion for his U. of North-Carolina and he made the winning shot. He was a two-time Olympic gold medalist, including with the 1992 Dream Team. Jordan's number 23 was retired by the Bulls and he has a statue of his likeness in the United Center. 
                He was voted a top 50 all-time NBA player and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.</p>
