                <h1>Brand activism</h1> 
                <p>This is a story of how Nike became the leader of brand activism overnight. 
                Brand activism is a concept that demands brands to stand up for a value they believe in, in order to reach out to the social instincts of its customers. 
                More often than not, this requires the brand to sacrifice a section of its customers to appeal to the majority, but that's a given while taking any stand, 
                you have people who agree with you and those who don't and as a brand you just have to hope that those who agree are either more in number or make up majority of your customer base. 
                In today's day and age markets are constantly being polarised by various political issues and it's upto brands to capitalise on the same, as the excessive use of social media for the most trivial of things has led to more awareness amongst the people, 
                especially the millennials, who actively debate on these forums, leaving a range of strongly opinionated people in its wake. This is better termed as progressive brand activism.</p>
                <h2>Just do it</h2>
                <p>“Just do it” has lasted three decades in part because of its universality. 
                It can be applied to casual joggers and elite athletes alike. In the case of Kaepernick, who hasn't played professional football since 2016,
                it's applied to him as an activist. Pairing the slogan with the ad's copy - “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” 
                - transforms the “it” of “Just do it” from touchdowns or workouts into standing up for one's beliefs.
                The move suggests Nike customers will be OK with the company taking a side over the controversial protests. It's not without risk, however, with the price of Nike stock falling Tuesday. 
                But at a time when a number of high-profile athletes are unwilling to “shut up and dribble,” Nike is positioning itself as a brand for them and their fans, 
                and expanding the aspirations of “Just do it” from the field, court, and track to politics, even if that means losing some sports fans in the process.</p>
